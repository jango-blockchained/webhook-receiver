# Webhook Receiver

A Cloudflare Worker service that acts as the entry point for TradingView alerts and other trading signals. This worker validates incoming webhooks and forwards them to the appropriate worker services.

[![Deploy to Cloudflare Workers](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/yourusername/hoox-trading/tree/main/webhook-receiver)

## Features

- TradingView webhook integration
- Request validation and sanitization
- Secure communication with other workers
- Error handling and logging
- Rate limiting support
- Telegram notifications

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 16
- Bun (for package management)
- Wrangler CLI
- Cloudflare Workers account

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

2. Set your Cloudflare account ID in `wrangler.toml`:
```toml
name = "webhook-receiver"
account_id = "your_account_id_here"
main = "src/index.js"
```

3. Configure environment variables in `.dev.vars` for local development:
```env
INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY=your_internal_key
API_SECRET_KEY=your_api_secret_key
TRADE_WORKER_URL=http://localhost:8788
TELEGRAM_WORKER_URL=http://localhost:8790
```

4. Configure production secrets:
```bash
wrangler secret put INTERNAL_SERVICE_KEY
wrangler secret put API_SECRET_KEY
```

5. Update the worker URLs in `wrangler.toml` for production:
```toml
[vars]
TRADE_WORKER_URL = "https://your-trade-worker.workers.dev"
TELEGRAM_WORKER_URL = "https://your-telegram-worker.workers.dev"
```

## Development

### Local Development

For local development, this worker should run on port 8789:

```bash
bun run dev -- --port 8789
```

The worker uses environment variables from `.dev.vars` during local development instead of the values in `wrangler.toml` or Cloudflare secrets.

### Production Deployment

Deploy to production:
```bash
bun run deploy
```
